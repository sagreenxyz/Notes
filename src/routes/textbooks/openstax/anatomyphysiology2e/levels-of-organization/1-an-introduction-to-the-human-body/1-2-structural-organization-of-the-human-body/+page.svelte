<h1>Key Points</h1>
<h2>Levels of Organization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The structure of the human body can be studied through different levels of organization, increasing in complexity.</li>
  <li>These levels are hierarchical, with higher levels built from lower ones:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chemical Level:</strong> The simplest building blocks of matter, including subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules.</li>
    <li><strong>Cellular Level:</strong> The smallest independently functioning units of life, consisting of cells and organelles.</li>
    <li><strong>Tissue Level:</strong> Groups of similar cells working together to perform specific functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Organ Level:</strong> Distinct structures composed of two or more tissue types performing specific physiological functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Organ System Level:</strong> Groups of organs working together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Organism Level:</strong> The highest level, representing a living being where all systems work together to maintain life and health.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>This organization is crucial for the function of the human organism.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chemical Level of Organization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The chemical level encompasses the simplest building blocks of matter, including:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subatomic particles:</strong> Protons, neutrons, electrons.</li>
      <li><strong>Atoms:</strong> The smallest unit of an element, such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.</li>
      <li><strong>Molecules:</strong> Formed when two or more atoms combine, like water, proteins, and sugars.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These chemical entities are the basis for all structures in the body.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<div class="admonishment question">
  <h3>What are the 6 levels of organization?</h3>
  <p>The six levels of organization are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chemical Level:</strong> The simplest building blocks of matter, including subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules.</li>
    <li><strong>Cellular Level:</strong> The smallest independently functioning units of life, consisting of cells and organelles.</li>
    <li><strong>Tissue Level:</strong> Groups of similar cells working together to perform specific functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Organ Level:</strong> Distinct structures composed of two or more tissue types performing specific physiological functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Organ System Level:</strong> Groups of organs working together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Organism Level:</strong> The highest level, representing a living being where all systems work together to maintain life and health.</li>
