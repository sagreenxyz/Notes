## Homework Questions

### Question 1
**The first place your food will go is the oral cavity.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **True**  
  **Explanation:** The oral cavity (mouth) is the first part of the digestive system where food enters. It is where mechanical digestion (chewing) and chemical digestion (saliva breaking down carbohydrates) begin.

---

### Question 2
**Chewing is the enzymatic breakdown of food.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **False**  
  **Explanation:** Chewing is a mechanical process, not enzymatic. It physically breaks food into smaller pieces to increase the surface area for enzymes in saliva to act on.

---

### Question 3
**A bolus is a sphere of digested food.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **True**  
  **Explanation:** A bolus is a soft, rounded mass of chewed food mixed with saliva, formed in the mouth and ready to be swallowed. It is not fully digested but is prepared for further digestion in the stomach.

---

### Question 4
**Chyme is a more digested bolus that then moves into the esophagus.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **False**  
  **Explanation:** Chyme is a semi-liquid mixture of partially digested food and digestive juices formed in the stomach. It does not move into the esophagus; instead, it moves into the small intestine for further digestion and absorption.

### Question 5
**In the colon, there is a lot of digestion that occurs.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **False**  
  **Explanation:** The colon (large intestine) is primarily responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes, not digestion. Most digestion occurs in the stomach and small intestine. The colon mainly processes waste and prepares it for elimination.
