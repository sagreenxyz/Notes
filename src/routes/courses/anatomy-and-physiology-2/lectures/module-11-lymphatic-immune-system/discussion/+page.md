## Summary
The **lymphatic system** plays a critical role in supporting the immune system. It is not only responsible for maintaining fluid balance but also actively defends the body against pathogens.

Key points about the immune system include:

* **Lymph nodes** act as checkpoints where immune cells inspect lymph for pathogens. They can trigger localized responses or alert the entire immune system if needed.
* **Lymphoid organs** like the spleen, thymus, adenoids, and tonsils house immune cells that engulf harmful antigens and fight infections.
* The **thymus and spleen** serve as nurseries for maturing immune cells called lymphocytes.
* **Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs)**, such as tonsils and Peyer’s patches, are strategically located to intercept pathogens at entry points like the respiratory and digestive tracts.
* The **appendix**, often misunderstood, contains lymphoid tissue that helps destroy bacteria before they breach the intestinal wall.

Overall, the lymphatic system provides essential support to the immune system by housing and mobilizing immune cells to detect and eliminate threats.

> The lymphatic system keeps the body healthy by supporting the immune system and maintaining fluid balance. It can be characterized as a network of checkpoints spread throughout the body, like lymph nodes, that inspect lymph fluid for infectious agents. These nodes have immune cells, such as lymphocytes and macrophages, which fight infections while in the node and recruit helpers when needed.

> The components of the lymphatic system are the spleen, thymus, tonsils, and other lymphoid tissues. The thymus and spleen are where lymphocytes mature into effective fighters. Another area of interest for the lymphatic system is mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs), which are in the digestive and respiratory tracts, to fight pathogens before they reach further into the body. Other tissues of interest are the tonsils, Peyer’s patches in the small intestine, and the appendix, which target pathogens before they can cause greater harm. What is interesting is how the system works relatively independently and in a certain specialty to fight pathogens, allowing the other organ systems to perform their functions without also having to fight infections.
