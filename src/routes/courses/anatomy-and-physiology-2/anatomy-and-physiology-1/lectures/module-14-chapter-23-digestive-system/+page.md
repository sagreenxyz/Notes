### Homework Questions
#### Question 1
**The first place your food will go is the oral cavity.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **True**  
  **Explanation:** The oral cavity (mouth) is the first part of the digestive system where food enters. It is where mechanical digestion (chewing) and chemical digestion (saliva breaking down carbohydrates) begin.
#### Question 2
**Chewing is the enzymatic breakdown of food.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **False**  
  **Explanation:** Chewing is a mechanical process, not enzymatic. It physically breaks food into smaller pieces to increase the surface area for enzymes in saliva to act on.
#### Question 3
**A bolus is a sphere of digested food.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **True**  
  **Explanation:** A bolus is a soft, rounded mass of chewed food mixed with saliva, formed in the mouth and ready to be swallowed. It is not fully digested but is prepared for further digestion in the stomach.
#### Question 4
**Chyme is a more digested bolus that then moves into the esophagus.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **False**  
  **Explanation:** Chyme is a semi-liquid mixture of partially digested food and digestive juices formed in the stomach. It does not move into the esophagus; instead, it moves into the small intestine for further digestion and absorption.
#### Question 5
**In the colon, there is a lot of digestion that occurs.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **False**  
  **Explanation:** The colon (large intestine) is primarily responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes, not digestion. Most digestion occurs in the stomach and small intestine. The colon mainly processes waste and prepares it for elimination.
### Quiz Questions

#### Question 1
**Which of the following membranes covers the stomach?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Visceral peritoneum**  
  **Explanation:** The visceral peritoneum is the membrane that directly covers the stomach and other abdominal organs.

---

#### Question 2
**The ____________________ system benefits the digestive system by ______________________________________________.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Nervous, Sensory and motor neurons that help regulate secretions and muscle contractions in the digestive tract**  
  **Explanation:** The nervous system plays a key role in regulating digestive processes through sensory and motor neurons.

---

#### Question 3
**The _________________ is the final segment of the large intestine.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Anal canal**  
  **Explanation:** The anal canal is the terminal part of the large intestine, leading to the anus for waste elimination.

---

#### Question 4
**Which of these nutrients is absorbed mainly in the duodenum?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Iron**  
  **Explanation:** Iron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.

---

#### Question 5
**Which of these is involved in the chemical digestion of protein?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Trypsin**  
  **Explanation:** Trypsin is an enzyme secreted by the pancreas that helps break down proteins into smaller peptides.

---

#### Question 6
**Where does the chemical digestion of starch begin?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Mouth**  
  **Explanation:** The enzyme amylase in saliva begins the chemical digestion of starch in the mouth.

---

#### Question 7
**Where are most fat-digesting enzymes produced?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Pancreas**  
  **Explanation:** The pancreas produces lipase, the primary enzyme responsible for fat digestion.

---

#### Question 8
**During gastric emptying, chyme is released into the duodenum through the ________.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Pyloric sphincter**  
  **Explanation:** The pyloric sphincter regulates the release of chyme from the stomach into the duodenum.

---

#### Question 9
**Which of these statements about the pharynx is true?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **The oropharynx begins inferior to the nasopharynx and is continuous below with the laryngopharynx.**  
  **Explanation:** The oropharynx is part of the pharynx that connects the nasopharynx to the laryngopharynx.

---

#### Question 10
**Which structure is located where the esophagus penetrates the diaphragm?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Esophageal hiatus**  
  **Explanation:** The esophageal hiatus is the opening in the diaphragm through which the esophagus passes.

---

#### Question 11
**Which phase of deglutition involves contraction of the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Esophageal phase**  
  **Explanation:** The esophageal phase involves peristaltic contractions of the muscularis to move food to the stomach.

---

#### Question 12
**Which of these organs is not considered an accessory digestive structure?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Mouth**  
  **Explanation:** The mouth is part of the alimentary canal, not an accessory structure like the pancreas or liver.

---

#### Question 13
**Which of these cells secrete hormones?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Enteroendocrine cells**  
  **Explanation:** Enteroendocrine cells secrete hormones like gastrin, which regulate digestive processes.

---

#### Question 14
**Parietal cells secrete ________.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Hydrochloric acid**  
  **Explanation:** Parietal cells in the stomach secrete hydrochloric acid, which aids in digestion and activates pepsinogen.

---

#### Question 15
**Which of these is most associated with villi?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Lacteals**  
  **Explanation:** Lacteals are lymphatic vessels in the villi that absorb dietary fats.

---

#### Question 16
**What is the role of the small intestineâ€™s MALT?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Preventing bacteria from entering the bloodstream**  
  **Explanation:** Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in the small intestine helps protect against pathogens.

---

#### Question 17
**Which of these processes occurs throughout most of the alimentary canal?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Propulsion**  
  **Explanation:** Propulsion moves food through the digestive tract via peristalsis and segmentation.

---

#### Question 18
**Which part of the large intestine attaches to the appendix?**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Cecum**  
  **Explanation:** The appendix is attached to the cecum, the first part of the large intestine.

---

#### Question 19
**Pancreatic juice ________.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Buffers chyme.**  
  **Explanation:** Pancreatic juice contains bicarbonate, which neutralizes the acidic chyme entering the small intestine.

---

#### Question 20
**The ________________________________ is the midline mucous membrane fold that attaches the inner surface of the lips to the gums.**  
- **Correct Answer:** **Labial frenulum**  
  **Explanation:** The labial frenulum is the fold of mucous membrane that connects the lips to the gums.
