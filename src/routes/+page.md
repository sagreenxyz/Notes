## Chapter 3 - Homework

### Question 1
**What happens to the small and large ribosomal subunits at the end of translation?**  
- **Correct Answer:** They separate and move and are free to join translation of other segments of mRNA.  
- They separate to form DNA.  
- They stay together to form amino acids.  
- They stay together to form larger molecules.  
**Explanation:** At the end of translation, the ribosomal subunits disassemble and are reused for translating other mRNA molecules.

### Question 2
**More specifically, on what structure are proteins synthesized?**  
- RNA  
- **Correct Answer:** Ribosomes  
- DNA  
- Amino acids  
**Explanation:** Ribosomes are the cellular structures where protein synthesis occurs, translating mRNA into polypeptides.

### Question 3
**To whom does the DNA give instructions to build a protein?**  
- rDNA  
- **Correct Answer:** mRNA  
- mDNA  
- rRNA  
**Explanation:** DNA provides instructions to mRNA, which carries the genetic code to ribosomes for protein synthesis.

### Question 4
**During what phase of the cell cycle is the DNA replicated?**  
- G2  
- G1  
- Cytokinesis  
- **Correct Answer:** S  
**Explanation:** DNA replication occurs during the S (synthesis) phase of the cell cycle.

### Question 5
**Every type of cell goes through mitosis.**  
- **Correct Answer:** False  
- True  
**Explanation:** Not all cells undergo mitosis. For example, mature red blood cells and neurons do not divide.

### Question 1
**The diffusion of substances within a solution tends to move those substances ________ their concentration gradient.**  
- **Correct Answer:** Down  
- Up  
**Explanation:** Diffusion moves substances from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration, down their concentration gradient.

---

### Question 2
**Ion pumps and phagocytosis are both examples of ________.**  
- Endocytosis  
- Facilitated transport  
- Passive transport  
- **Correct Answer:** Active transport  
**Explanation:** Both ion pumps and phagocytosis require energy (ATP), making them forms of active transport.

---

### Question 3
**The rough ER has its name due to what associated structures?**  
- Lysosomes  
- Proteins  
- Golgi apparatus  
- **Correct Answer:** Ribosomes  
**Explanation:** The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is studded with ribosomes, giving it a "rough" appearance.

---

### Question 4
**Which of the following is a feature common to all three components of the cytoskeleton?**  
- They all help the cell resist compression and tension.  
- They all serve to scaffold the organelles within the cell.  
- They are all characterized by roughly the same diameter.  
- **Correct Answer:** They are all polymers of protein subunits.  
**Explanation:** All cytoskeletal components (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules) are made of protein subunits.

---

### Question 5
**The nucleus and mitochondria share which of the following features?**  
- Protein-lined membrane pores  
- The production of cellular energy  
- The synthesis of ribosomes  
- **Correct Answer:** A double cell membrane  
**Explanation:** Both the nucleus and mitochondria are surrounded by a double membrane.

---

### Question 6
**Which of the following sequences on a DNA molecule would be complementary to GCTTATAT?**  
- TGCCTCTC  
- ATCCGCGC  
- TAGGCGCG  
- **Correct Answer:** CGAATATA  
**Explanation:** DNA base pairing rules dictate that G pairs with C and A pairs with T.

---

### Question 7
**Which of the following phases is characterized by preparation for DNA synthesis?**  
- G0  
- S  
- **Correct Answer:** G1  
- Interphase  
**Explanation:** The G1 phase is the first gap phase where the cell grows and prepares for DNA replication.

---

### Question 8
**How many “letters” of an RNA molecule, in sequence, does it take to provide the code for a single amino acid?**  
- 1  
- 2  
- 4  
- **Correct Answer:** 3  
**Explanation:** A codon, consisting of three RNA nucleotides, codes for a single amino acid.

---

### Question 9
**Which of the following are not one of the main types of RNA involved in protein synthesis?**  
- tRNA  
- mRNA  
- rRNA  
- **Correct Answer:** fRNA  
**Explanation:** The main types of RNA involved in protein synthesis are mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA. fRNA is not a recognized type.

---

### Question 10
**Which of the following is part of the elongation step of DNA synthesis?**  
- Untwisting the DNA helix  
- Pulling apart the two DNA strands  
- None of these answers  
- **Correct Answer:** Attaching complementary nucleotides to the template strand  
**Explanation:** During elongation, DNA polymerase adds complementary nucleotides to the growing DNA strand.

---

### Question 11
**Place the following structures in order from least to most complex organization: chromatin, nucleosome, DNA, chromosome.**  
- Nucleosome, chromatin, DNA, chromosome  
- Nucleosome, DNA, chromosome, chromatin  
- **Correct Answer:** DNA, nucleosome, chromatin, chromosome  
- DNA, chromatin, nucleosome, chromosome  
**Explanation:** DNA is the simplest structure, which wraps around histones to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes form chromatin, which condenses into chromosomes.

---

### Question 12
**What type of diffusion is of a substance with the aid of a membrane protein?**  
- ATP diffusion  
- Simple diffusion  
- Enunciated diffusion  
- **Correct Answer:** Facilitated diffusion  
**Explanation:** Facilitated diffusion uses membrane proteins to help substances cross the cell membrane without energy.

---

### Question 13
**What multipotent stem cells from children are sometimes banked by parents?**  
- Embryonic stem cells  
- **Correct Answer:** Cells from the umbilical cord and from baby teeth  
- Hematopoietic stem cells from red and white blood cells  
- Fetal stem cells  
**Explanation:** Umbilical cord and baby teeth stem cells are commonly banked for their potential medical use.

---

### Question 14
**Arrange the following terms in order of increasing specialization: oligopotency, pleuripotency, unipotency, multipotency.**  
- Oligopotency, pleuripotency, unipotency, multipotency
