                    <li>difficulty expressing fluid</li>
                    <li>difficulty inflating the lungs</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> difficulty inflating the lungs</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Pulmonary surfactant, produced by type II cells, reduces surface tension in the alveoli, making it easier for the lungs to inflate. Without sufficient surfactant, premature infants may struggle to breathe.</p>

                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Chloride is exchanged for bicarbonate.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The chloride shift is a process in which chloride ions move into red blood cells as bicarbonate ions move out, helping to maintain the acid-base balance in the blood.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Which of the following processes does atmospheric pressure play a role in?</p>

                    <li>sacral</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> thoracic</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The thoracic region of the vertebral column allows for the greatest range of rotational movement due to the orientation of the facet joints.</p>

                <p>Synovial joints ________.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>are produced by intramembranous ossification</li>
                    <li>are derived from fontanelles</li>
                    <li>are produced by endochondral ossification</li>
                    <li>develop at an interzone site</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> develop at an interzone site</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Synovial joints develop at an interzone site, where mesenchymal cells differentiate into the structures that form the joint cavity and associated tissues.</p>

                <p>A __________________ is a slightly mobile joint.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>pivot</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> amphiarthrosis</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> An amphiarthrosis is a type of joint that allows for limited movement, providing both stability and flexibility, such as the intervertebral discs.</p>

                <p>Which of the following contain channels within the bone matrix that house one of an osteocyte’s many cytoplasmic extensions that it uses to communicate and receive nutrients?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>diploë</li>
                    <li>cartilage</li>
                    <li>compact bone</li>
                    <li>canaliculi</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> canaliculi</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Canaliculi are small channels within the bone matrix that house the cytoplasmic extensions of osteocytes, allowing for communication and nutrient exchange.</p>
